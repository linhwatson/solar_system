## :sunflower: Project Overview
:exploding_head: Have you ever wished that you could create a whole universe with your hands? Seems impossible but you DEFINITELY CAN!! 
The objective of this project is to deliver a simple and fun demonstration of our beautiful solar system in a special way. 

## :muscle: Motivation
This project was created within a 2-day period (less than 24 hours) as part of the Hack Reactor's curriculum.
It was a really nice opportunity for me to get familiar with more technologies such as threeJS and mediapipe.
I hope it will inspire you to also build something cool and/or learn something new. 

## :fire: Project Details
* Snap to create the stars
* Snap to create the planets
* Either open or close both hands to rotate around the solar system

## :sparkles: Roadmap - Future Optimizations
* Implementing rings for some planets such as Saturn, etc.
* Adding more interactive functionalities with hand tracking
* Improving response time of hand tracking when adding an audio in threeJS
